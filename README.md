I am a **Research Scientist** by background, with a PhD in Neuroscience. I specialised in neuroimaging, specifically Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). I have investigated the neural, vascular and metabolic function of the human brain and how these functions change in Multiple Sclerosis.  I have developed and refined methods of measuring brain signals, examining different interpretations of what these signals tell us about brain health.

### ðŸ§  (2022 - Present) Data Wrangler at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/rachael-stickland)

  <br />

Data Wranglers can be viewed as a specialised type of data scientist, primarily working in the space between data generators and data analysts. Read a description from The Turing Way book: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/data-wrangler.html. 

The research projects I work on use large population health databases (often electronic health records derived from primary care data). This data rarely comes **AI-ready** or **research-ready**. I create re-usable, accessible and efficient analytical workflows to help prepare data for specific use cases.
