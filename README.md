## Dr Rachael Stickland (she/her)

### ðŸ§  **Research Scientist** by background, with a **PhD in neuroscience**

<details>
  <summary>Click for more details - for instance, What type of neuroscience?</summary> 
  <br />
  
  I specialised in neuroimaging, specifically **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**. I have investigated the neural, vascular and metabolic function of the human brain and how these functions changed in **Multiple Sclerosis**.  I have developed and refined **methods of measuring brain signals**, examining different interpretations of what these signals tell us about brain health.

  <br />

Data Wranglers can be viewed as a specialised type of data scientist, primarily working in the space between data generators and data analysts. Read more [here](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/data-wrangler.html). The research projects I work on use large population health databases (often electronic health records derived from primacy care data). This data rarely comes **AI-ready** or **research-ready**. I create re-usable, accessible and efficient analytical workflows to help prepare data for specific use cases.
